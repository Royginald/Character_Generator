This is a comprehensive character generator for Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition

The main file is in scr/com.compay/Main.java when this file is executed a random character will be generated and displayed in text form.

When the program is run the first option that appears will be the option to customize, selecting yes will first allow you to choose if you would like an NPC,
then you will be able to select you race and class followed by your level. The main difference with NPCs is that they have slightly worse stats.

After these options are chosen your character will be generated.

If you choose not to customize, you will simply be asked to choose a level then the rest of the process will be randomized (you won't get an NPC with this option).

The program will generate a fully random name, background, race and class (if not already chosen).

Based on these your speed, equipment, proficiency bonus and gold will be displayed.

You will also be given random stats that are suited to your class, the corresponding bonus will also be displayed.

The program also displays your features (from both race and class), hit points, hit dice, armor class, known languages, and your available spell slots.

I am currently working on the spell selection process, it still has a couple bugs, but its mostly functional. It will give you a random selection of spells
from your class based on your level and features.

Eventually this program will incorporate a GUI to cleanly display all the generated information.
